# Imposter: A scriptable, multipurpose mock server [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/outofcoffee/imposter/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/outofcoffee/imposter/tree/master)

Reliable, scriptable and extensible mock server for REST APIs,
[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (and Swagger) specifications,
Salesforce and HBase APIs.

Run standalone mock servers, or embed mocks within your tests (supports JVM and Node.js).

Dynamic responses can be scripted using JavaScript or Groovy/Java.

## Features

* run standalone mocks in place of real systems
* turn an OpenAPI/Swagger file into a mock API for testing or QA (even before the real API is built)
* decouple your integration tests from the cloud/various back-end systems and take control of your dependencies
* validate your API requests against an OpenAPI specification
* capture data and validate later or use response templates to provide conditional responses

Send dynamic responses:

- Provide mock responses using static files or customise behaviour based on characteristics of the request.
- Power users can control mock responses with JavaScript or Java/Groovy script engines.
- Advanced users can write their own plugins in a JVM language of their choice.

## Getting started

The quickest way to get up and running is to use the free cloud-hosted service at **[mocks.cloud](https://www.mocks.cloud)**

# Plugins

Imposter uses plugins to control its behaviour and provide specialised mocks:

* **[OpenAPI](docs/openapi_plugin.md)** - Support for [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (and Swagger) API specifications.
* **[REST](docs/rest_plugin.md)** - Mocks RESTful or plain HTTP APIs.
* **[HBase](docs/hbase_plugin.md)** - Basic HBase mock implementation.
* **[SFDC (Salesforce) plugin](docs/sfdc_plugin.md)** - Basic Salesforce mock implementation.

You can also create your own plugins, using a JVM language of your choice.

# Example

```shell
$ imposter up

Starting server on port 8080...
Parsing configuration file: someapi-config.yaml
...
Mock server is up and running
```

Your mock server is now running!

You can hit the URL [http://localhost:8080/users](http://localhost:8080/users) to see the mock response:

```shell
$ curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8080/users/alice

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{ "userName": "alice" }
```

# How to run Imposter
